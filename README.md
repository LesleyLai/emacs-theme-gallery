emacs-theme-gallery
===================

All screenshots are taken by running elisp/emacsThemes.el. If you want
to add a screenshot, you can edit emacsThemes.el and create a pull
request or open a new issue for this repository and I'll add it
myself.

The "popular" sort order is based on downloads from MELPA, a statistic
that is retrieved every time you visit the themes gallery website. The
themes that lack a download stat are themes that are bundled with
emacs.
